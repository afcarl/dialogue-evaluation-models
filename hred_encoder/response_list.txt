   The command is actually grub-install . not quite sure how to test if you have it for grub or grub2 though .

I check the display setting already if that what your talking about

   exactly
using sudo to run ifconfig is pointless in itself

   Did you install proprietary drivers in the last session before rebooting ?  yes Nvidia  OK ... sounds like you need to run " nvidia x settings " ... type " nvidia " in the dashboard  That allowed me to fix the problem . What would cause that ?
   and i was just trying to point you to the official docs giving pretty much infos about current packages in the current lts release . wish you good luck with the screen setup ;)
I think it would be that the driver couldn't determine the optimum mode from what the display told it
   how do i know which programs are using internet connection ?  What do you mean ?

   i believe so
Yea , it has 2 nameserver entries with the same nameservers

   thats what i figured , but personally i doubt that the ops will get mad at me since that wasnt really trolling , that was just a light joke . and im here forn support , just like the other people here . some of the ops may even recognize me as a long time member , but then again , knowing my luck , they may not . if you took offence to it , i apologize sincerely have you tried an older version of ubuntu ? i am using 10.04 LTS , and have never had any problems with it . since its been out longer , its had more time to had the bugs ironed out . you might want to give it a try , although unfortunantly , support will br terminated in 2013 are you using a server edition ?

   Hey everyone , is there an Ubuntu consultant group I can hire ? I have machines to manage but the problems are over my head someone who specializes in such things  canonical.com offers paid support contracts
   So you're saying that canonical is help with a small " h " and is still reasonably affordable . I'm talking about a home network .

   Are there any estimates for when the Steam for Linux Beta will be out ?  they want to release it for oktoberfest
   I imagine , I don't really use software-center , the version numbers match the page you link though
Are there any sources , or is that an estimate of your own ?  What site was that ? I can't find any dates whatsoever
   Did you install proprietary drivers in the last session before rebooting ?  yes Nvidia  OK ... sounds like you need to run " nvidia x settings " ... type " nvidia " in the dashboard  That allowed me to fix the problem . What would cause that ?
   I probably cannot help with being stuck on VESA . What I can tell you is that the radeon driver likely will work but not well , that many crucial compositing operations will still not be hardware accelerated , and compiz and/or unity will crash often . I recommend sticking with 12.04 until the ATI situation improves a lot . So , no one here knows about altering the background colors for program icons in the Unity Launcher ? Not the launcher overall background color , but the background per icon .
I think it would be that the driver couldn't determine the optimum mode from what the display told it
   Are there any estimates for when the Steam for Linux Beta will be out ?  they want to release it for oktoberfest
   yeah its working ! **unknown** just went live ~20 minutes ago

I have 2 monitors and there is the unity taskbar on the left of the left most monitor *and* a taskbar on the left of the right most monitor . Right in the middle . Anyway to turn that middle on off ?
It was a clean install working at 1920 as a wide screen display without problems then after a reboot it is running 1280x1040 and says it is a laptop .
   only the first time , anytime after that for 5 minutes will not prompt for password  Right , but at some point , a password needs to be supplied , so using sudo in a script is a problem
   how can i run admin without sudo?
using sudo to run ifconfig is pointless in itself
   thanks  assuming grub2 can boot solaris .. ive no idea what bootloader it uses .. mey be easier to just play with solaris in virtualbox
   I know , but I have a **unknown** **unknown** and I want to use it for my **unknown**
it uses a modified grub i guess  nah .. its too slow
   is there a script that can generate a live cd iso of your currently running ubuntu hdd install ?  remastersys  have you used it ?
   yes
I havn't had much luck with it , but that was a while ago ( 2 years )
   done , no output .  good , now do , sudo iwlist wlan0 scan|grep -i essid  I get the essid of my wireless network  now try to connect with network manager
   then set up the folder in windows to share and you should be able to use the networking with ssh ( sftp ) in nautilus to access the windows folder and place in places in nautilus .. not sure about rsync with windows
I cannot see network manager .
   Are there any estimates for when the Steam for Linux Beta will be out ?  they want to release it for oktoberfest
   I know , but I want to know if there is a way to get it to work with wine , or is there a way to do it ?
Are there any sources , or is that an estimate of your own ?  What site was that ? I can't find any dates whatsoever
   so now i'm going to try it with the snapshot version of the PPA instead and see if it crashes again .  Are you looking at your computer 's CPU temperature ?  no but i havent ever had any trouble with temp before .... where do i go to see its temp rypervenche ?
   I don't know what you mean by " sensors "
That depends on your hardware and kernel . The Ubuntu guys can help you with that .
   anyone have experience creating a bootable usb for a mac ? I keep getting an invalid disk image message I tried using linux live usb creator for windows and the official ubuntu guide for macs to no avail  try using UNETBOOTIN

   try with program called unetbootin , it 's a simple GUI application for making bootable usb drives .

   does anyone even know what it is in unbuntu that caches ssh passphrases on a stock ubunutu ( 12.04 ) installation  ssh-agent  are you sure ? when I try and manually run " ssh-add " then I get can not open a conenction to ssh-agent
   no , it 's not . ssh-agent is running on the server , so it 's not a daemon .
It was last I checked , but that may have been an earlier release  Just booted up my laptop with 12.04 , and it does indeed use ssh-agent
   if I change my pc from intel to amd , ( changing motherboard and stuff like that , but not the HDD ) do I have to reinstall ubuntu ?  no  so I just change the hardware and boot the PC , no settups or anything like that ?
   you can boot from a live cd and install grub to the mbr
correct . ubuntu is a lot nicer with hardware changes than windows

   sorry :) - try this : http://sourceforge.net what does SPICE do ?

   guys does wine-doors still works on ubuntu 12.04 ? if so anyone can help me install it please ? thank you :)  It 's unmaintained , so it might and it might not . why do you think it won't run ? Did you try it ?
   i've got class in a few minutes , but that looks like the source code for thunderbird 2.0 . Untar the archive and there should be a README with instructions inside for compiling it .
yes I did and it doesn't unfortunately :)  yes I tried all latest ... i found the sourceforge link and downloaded the thing but dunno what to do with it
   how do i know which programs are using internet connection ?  What do you mean ?
   the thing : k4k didn't know that there was harware that supported both 98se and 7
i want to see which program uses internet most  you don't know ?

   nothing . wine just kind of works most of the time . if not , try googling the program and see what other people have done to make it work .

   Hey everyone , is there an Ubuntu consultant group I can hire ? I have machines to manage but the problems are over my head someone who specializes in such things  canonical.com offers paid support contracts
   thanks
anyone but canonical ? Their " certified " list doesn't include any of the machines I have to support  I just need some additional resources , not promised anything
   done , no output .  good , now do , sudo iwlist wlan0 scan|grep -i essid  I get the essid of my wireless network  now try to connect with network manager
   I have done that , but I still get the same error .
I cannot see network manager .
   i can't mount my drive i formatted with 12.04 i can read it if i load live cd on the original computer but no other computers  Please run " sudo parted -l | pastebinit " and post the URL that it outputs here .  i can't -- i have no mouse  My instructions do not require a mouse .
   I've reinstalled many times and it either makes it worse ( borks bootloader ) or does nothing . I might try a console installation next , if it 's not too hard .
thanks for trying to help -- i don't have the keyboard skills to pastebin from terminal without a mouse
   thanks  assuming grub2 can boot solaris .. ive no idea what bootloader it uses .. mey be easier to just play with solaris in virtualbox
   sure chek that .. some said that may be the fat32 not being recognice for the old bios ... but when tring to instal the usblive on the flash formated on exfat it gives an error on the syslinux instalation .. sais won't be bootable ...

   how do I move programs and all their dependencies automatically ?  you mean between two Ubuntu installations ?
   no. like when i install stuff from the internet, i want it to go in a different place without me having to manually move it all the time.
I have a chroot partition I've been using ldd and doing it manually but it is quite slow
   I have the following /etc/network/interfaces file ( **unknown** . When my machine starts up , it correctly sets the static ip , but dns resolution fails until I ifdown then ifup . How can I fix that ?  Did you check the /etc/resolv . conf yet ?
   no , i'm not saying for my use case . I was suggesting that the login screen is modular to the whole lightdm process
Yea , it has 2 nameserver entries with the same nameservers
   if I change my pc from intel to amd , ( changing motherboard and stuff like that , but not the HDD ) do I have to reinstall ubuntu ?  no  so I just change the hardware and boot the PC , no settups or anything like that ?
   yup. no reason why the os should need a re-install after those changes.
correct . ubuntu is a lot nicer with hardware changes than windows
