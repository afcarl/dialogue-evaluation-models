did you install proprietary drivers in the last session before rebooting ? yes nvidia ok ... sounds like you need to run " nvidia x settings " ... type " nvidia " in the dashboard that allowed me to fix the problem . what would cause that ?
and i was just trying to point you to the official docs giving pretty much infos about current packages in the current lts release . wish you good luck with the screen setup ;)
i think it would be that the driver couldn't determine the optimum mode from what the display told it

thats what i figured , but personally i doubt that the ops will get mad at me since that wasnt really trolling , that was just a light joke . and im here forn support , just like the other people here . some of the ops may even recognize me as a long time member , but then again , knowing my luck , they may not . if you took offence to it , i apologize sincerely have you tried an older version of ubuntu ? i am using 10.04 lts , and have never had any problems with it . since its been out longer , its had more time to had the bugs ironed out . you might want to give it a try , although unfortunantly , support will br terminated in 2013 are you using a server edition ?

are there any estimates for when the steam for linux beta will be out ? they want to release it for oktoberfest
i imagine , i don't really use software-center , the version numbers match the page you link though
are there any sources , or is that an estimate of your own ? what site was that ? i can't find any dates whatsoever
did you install proprietary drivers in the last session before rebooting ? yes nvidia ok ... sounds like you need to run " nvidia x settings " ... type " nvidia " in the dashboard that allowed me to fix the problem . what would cause that ?
i probably cannot help with being stuck on vesa . what i can tell you is that the radeon driver likely will work but not well , that many crucial compositing operations will still not be hardware accelerated , and compiz and /or unity will crash often . i recommend sticking with 12.04 until the ati situation improves a lot . so , no one here knows about altering the background colors for program icons in the unity launcher ? not the launcher overall background color , but the background per icon .
i think it would be that the driver couldn't determine the optimum mode from what the display told it
are there any estimates for when the steam for linux beta will be out ? they want to release it for oktoberfest

only the first time , anytime after that for 5 minutes will not prompt for password right , but at some point , a password needs to be supplied , so using sudo in a script is a problem
